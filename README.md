# Part 1 
The summary data shows that the number of drivers increases in densely popular cities. The average fare is cheaper in urban areas ($16.57) while rural areas have higher average ($55.49) fares due to less available drivers (2,405 vs 78 respectively). 

Despite the low average, urban areas give the most revenue as seen by the total fares ($39,854.38) while rural area only generated much less ($4,237.93).

The suburban area falls between in the middle of urban and rural data, further confirming the trend seen by population density.

# Part 2
The urban fares and other type fares have an inverted relationship (ie: when urban fares sore, other areas see a decline in fares).

For example, there are few points in time where urban areas have an increase in rides while other areas have decline. Most likley the urban areas host events during these times (early March, mid-April). During the brief times (such as mid-late February and early April) when urban fares go down, rural and suburban fares went up.

Overall, throughout all months, urban area generated the most fares while rural areas generated the least.
